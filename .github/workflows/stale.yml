            This issue was marked stale because it has been open 60 days with
            no activity. Please remove the stale label or comment on this
            issue. Otherwise, it will be closed in 15 days.

            As an open-source project, we rely on community contributions to
            address many of the reported issues. Without a proposed fix or
            active work towards a solution it is our policy to close inactive
            issues. This is documented in CONTRIBUTING.rst

            **How to keep this issue open:**
            * If you are still experiencing this issue and are willing to
            investigate a fix, please comment and let us know.
            * If you (or someone else) can propose a pull request with a
            solution, that would be fantastic.
            * Any significant update or active discussion indicating progress
            will also prevent closure.

            We value your input. If you can help provide a fix, we'd be happy
            to keep this issue open and support your efforts.

          close-issue-message: |
            This issue was closed because it has been marked stale for 15 days
            with no activity.

            This open-source project relies on community contributions, and
            while we value all feedback, we have a limited capacity to address
            every issue without a clear path forward.

            Currently, this issue hasn't received a proposed fix, and there
            hasn't been recent active discussion indicating someone is planning
            to work on it. To maintain a manageable backlog and focus our
            efforts, we will be closing this issue for now.

            **This doesn't mean the issue isn't valid or important.** If you or
            anyone else in the community is willing to investigate and propose
            a solution (e.g., by submitting a pull request), please do.

            We believe that those who feel a bug is important enough to fix
            should ideally be part of the solution. Your contributions are
            highly welcome.

            Thank you for your understanding and potential future
            contributions.
