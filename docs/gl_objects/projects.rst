Use :class:`~gitlab.objects.Project` objects to manipulate projects. The
:attr:`gitlab.Gitlab.projects` manager objects provides helper functions.

Examples
========

List projects:

The API provides several filtering parameters for the listing methods:

* ``archived``: if ``True`` only archived projects will be returned
* ``visibility``: returns only projects with the specified visibility (can be
  ``public``, ``internal`` or ``private``)
* ``search``: returns project matching the given pattern

Results can also be sorted using the following parameters:

* ``order_by``: sort using the given argument. Valid values are ``id``,
  ``name``, ``path``, ``created_at``, ``updated_at`` and ``last_activity_at``.
  The default is to sort by ``created_at``
* ``sort``: sort order (``asc`` or ``desc``)

.. literalinclude:: projects.py
   :start-after: # list
   :end-before: # end list

Get a single project:

.. literalinclude:: projects.py
   :start-after: # get
   :end-before: # end get

Create a project:

.. literalinclude:: projects.py
   :start-after: # create
   :end-before: # end create

Create a project for a user (admin only):

.. literalinclude:: projects.py
   :start-after: # user create
   :end-before: # end user create

Create a project in a group:

You need to get the id of the group, then use the namespace_id attribute to create the group:

.. code:: python

  group_id = gl.groups.search('my-group')[0].id
  project = gl.projects.create({'name': 'myrepo', 'namespace_id': group_id})


Update a project:

.. literalinclude:: projects.py
   :start-after: # update
   :end-before: # end update

Delete a project:

.. literalinclude:: projects.py
   :start-after: # delete
   :end-before: # end delete

Fork a project:

.. literalinclude:: projects.py
   :start-after: # fork
   :end-before: # end fork

Create/delete a fork relation between projects (requires admin permissions):

.. literalinclude:: projects.py
   :start-after: # forkrelation
   :end-before: # end forkrelation

Star/unstar a project:

.. literalinclude:: projects.py
   :start-after: # star
   :end-before: # end star

Archive/unarchive a project:

.. literalinclude:: projects.py
   :start-after: # archive
   :end-before: # end archive

.. note::

   Previous versions used ``archive_`` and ``unarchive_`` due to a naming issue,
   they have been deprecated but not yet removed.

Repository
----------

The following examples show how you can manipulate the project code repository.

List the repository tree:

.. literalinclude:: projects.py
   :start-after: # board lists create
   :end-before: # end board lists create

Change a list position. The first list is at position 0. Moving a list will
insert it at the given position and move the following lists up a position:
