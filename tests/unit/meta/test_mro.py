"""
Ensure objects defined in gitlab.v4.objects have REST* as last item in class
definition

Original notes by John L. Villalovos

An example of an incorrect definition:
    class ProjectPipeline(RESTObject, RefreshMixin, ObjectDeleteMixin):
                          ^^^^^^^^^^ This should be at the end.

Correct way would be:
    class ProjectPipeline(RefreshMixin, ObjectDeleteMixin, RESTObject):
                                      Correctly at the end ^^^^^^^^^^


Why this is an issue:

  When we do type-checking for gitlab/mixins.py we make RESTObject or
  RESTManager the base class for the mixins

  Here is how our classes look when type-checking:

      class RESTObject:
          def __init__(self, manager: "RESTManager", attrs: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
              ...

      class Mixin(RESTObject):
          ...

      # Wrong ordering here
      class Wrongv4Object(RESTObject, RefreshMixin):
          ...

  If we actually ran this in Python we would get the following error:
         class Wrongv4Object(RESTObject, Mixin):
    TypeError: Cannot create a consistent method resolution
    order (MRO) for bases RESTObject, Mixin

  When we are type-checking it fails to understand the class Wrongv4Object
  and thus we can't type check it correctly.

Almost all classes in gitlab/v4/objects/*py were already correct before this
check was added.
